# Hello, World!

I feel like that phrase is a go-to when trying anything new for me. I can't think of anything else.

Hi there. I'm **Melvin**.

I'm twenty years old, and a student at the University of Manchester. I've just finished my Foundation Year and passed with flying colours, which I'm quite pleased with. I workout every morning, read every evening, and learn something every day.

This is probably the first time I'm trying to keep something simple.

I had so many different ideas for this website, such that it would have turned into a full-blown social network (or near enough) if I had gone through with it. And a badly written one at that. Comment systems, user profiles, OAuth integration. Of course, I have to build all of this from scratch because Wordpress and Disqus are evil (/sarcasm). And I have to be my own sysadmin because real computer scientists don't take the easy way out (again, I'm kidding).

First and foremost, I'm a learner and experimenter. Most things I've worked on have been an effort to learn something new, rather than to produce something that works. These projects then slowly turn into an effort to produce something that works. Then I become annoyed at myself for not finishing it, compounding the belief that I have no ability to learn anything.

Over the past two years, I've began to realise what I was doing was hurting me. It was engraving a mindset that bred negativity and the loss of love for what I was doing. I began to try and undo the damage I had done to myself. I learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned that I wasn't really an early bird *or* a night owl, I could be either. I learned that I liked being outside and exploring, something I had forgotten about. I learned that I had an IQ of 110 when I was eight, though it certainly didn't feel like it back then (I've also come to appreciate how unimportant, and fluid, IQ actually is). I learned about my ADHD when an older friend of mine mentioned how I reminded him of himself when he was my age.

I feel like I've changed a lot over the last couple of years. I've become fitter. I've become "smarter". I've become more driven, more focused, more goal-oriented. I've become calmer and more thoughtful. I've become way more confident, more sociable. I've turned from an introvert to an extravert (something that is biting me in the arse right now since I'm stuck in my parent's house for the summer).

I planned to create this website year ago. The primary purpose of it was to be a repository of my own thoughts, achievements, knowledge and creations. A blog. A portfolio. A place where I can show the world what I'm capable of. Then feature creep happened, and I started bouncing all over the place with new languages and frameworks. I've restarted this project several times.

This time, I'm going to force myself to keep things simple. I'm going to make myself develop iteratively, rather than trying to do everything at once. Which is why this site looks like a static web page. Because it is.

Currently, this blog post is sitting in a file called `hello-world.html`, in a folder named `posts`, in an Express application (written in pure JavaScript rather than CoffeeScript, a change from my previous intention) on a Digital Ocean droplet running Dokku. There is no database. There is no template engine being used (I wrote this in Markdown and compiled it on the command line).

I can almost hear people asking why I'm not using WordPress or something similar. It's because the content isn't actually the point of this site. I'm building this site to practice my skills, to learn new things. I want to learn how system administration works. I want to learn HTTP itself. I want to learn about web technologies. I want to learn about databases and security. I find those topics, plus several others, interesting. Using something pre made will not only make me take things for granted, but will also fail to keep me interested with new challenges and problems for me to solve.

This site will be a record of what I learn. Over time, it will gain new content, more blog posts, maybe links to projects and live demos. But the site itself will also evolve. Its look will evolve. It will gain more structure. It will gain new features, such as comments, or highlighting. As I keep creating, keep evolving, I intend to document every single thing I do, right here on this site.

So, hello world. My name is Melvin Sowah.  
This is the story of my journey.  
Let me share it with you.
