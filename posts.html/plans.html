          <h1>Plans</h1>

          <p>
            The last few months have been a bit hectic for me. Launching this blog, acting on a whim and having it pay off, a christening, travelling, working.

            If GCSE English taught me anything, it&#39;s that life doesn&#39;t go the way you want it to most of the time (GCSE English also taught me how to spin this lesson out of Forrest Gump).

            I&#39;ll be at my parents house for ten weeks. This is week five. I planned to be halfway through a Maths book by now. I forgot to leave room for the unexpected. I also forgot to account for having to babysit my little brother. Yeah, my plan has derailed a little.
          </p>

          <p>
            The thing about me and planning is that we have a bit of a love-hate relationship: I love making plans, but the plan never seems to want to materialise. I&#39;ve learned why, and I&#39;ll expand on that in another blog post, but the simple version is that I was trying to do too much with too little.
          </p>

          <p>
            What I wanted to talk about in this post is my plan for this website.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you were to look at the source code for this site, you would see a very basic setup. I&#39;m just parsing Markdown on a command line, then sticking it in a folder. This is a static site at the moment. The only fancy code I&#39;ve written allows the user to omit the <code>.html</code> extension in the URL.
          </p>

          <p>
            What I plan to do is let the website evolve over time. It&#39;ll be a source of programming challenges for me. Can I implement a login system? How would editing posts work? What about letting people leave comments on the site? (If you have any ideas for programming tasks I could do, <a href="https://twitter.com/melvisntnormal" title="Tweet me!">I&#39;d love to hear them!</a>)
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, this site will evolve. It&#39;ll have more features, a better design, cleaner code. The site is supposed to be a living record of my growth and learning, and I thought slowly building the site would be a good way to show that.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first challenge I&#39;ll set myself is adding a couple of dynamic elements. A sidebar to lists the posts I&#39;ve made, and a template that will be reused for every blog post. A pretty easy one, but the point of this isn&#39;t to immediately push myself. The goal of this for me is to start building a habit and simplify the way I think.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&#39;m hoping that by doing a little at a time, every day, I can learn to keep things simple and work on things consistently. If I jumped into something big, I&#39;d get distracted by other ideas I could implement, and eventually get overwhelmed by the ballooning scope of the project.
          </p>

          <p>
            A little at a time. That&#39;s my plan. Hopefully, it won&#39;t go awry this time.
