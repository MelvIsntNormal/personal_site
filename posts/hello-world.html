          <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

          <p>
            I feel like that phrase is a go-to when trying anything new for me. I can&#39;t think of anything
            else.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hi there. I&#39;m <strong>Melvin</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&#39;m twenty years old, and a student at the University of Manchester. I&#39;ve just finished
            my Foundation Year and passed with flying colours, which I&#39;m quite pleased with. I workout
            every morning, read every evening, and learn something every day.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is probably the first time I&#39;m trying to keep something simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had so many different ideas for this website, such that it would have turned into a full-blown
            social network (or near enough) if I had gone through with it. And a badly written one at that.
            Comment systems, user profiles, OAuth integration. Of course, I have to build all of this from
            scratch because Wordpress and Disqus are evil (/sarcasm). And I have to be my own sysadmin
            because real computer scientists don&#39;t take the easy way out (again, I&#39;m kidding).
          </p>

          <p>
            First and foremost, I&#39;m a learner and experimenter. Most things I&#39;ve worked on have been
            an effort to learn something new, rather than to produce something that works. These projects
            then slowly turn into an effort to produce something that works. Then I become annoyed at myself
            for not finishing it, compounding the belief that I have no ability to learn anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past two years, I&#39;ve began to realise what I was doing was hurting me. It was engraving
            a mindset that bred negativity and the loss of love for what I was doing. I began to try and
            undo the damage I had done to myself. I learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned
            that I wasn&#39;t really an early bird <em>or</em> a night owl, I could be either. I learned
            that I liked being outside and exploring, something I had forgotten about. I learned that I
            had an IQ of 110 when I was eight, though it certainly didn&#39;t feel like it back then (I&#39;ve
            also come to appreciate how unimportant, and fluid, IQ actually is). I learned about my ADHD
            when an older friend of mine mentioned how I reminded him of himself when he was my age.
          </p>

          <p>
            I feel like I&#39;ve changed a lot over the last couple of years. I&#39;ve become fitter. I&#39;ve
            become &quot;smarter&quot;. I&#39;ve become more driven, more focused, more goal-oriented.
            I&#39;ve become calmer and more thoughtful. I&#39;ve become way more confident, more sociable.
            I&#39;ve turned from an introvert to an extravert (something that is biting me in the arse
            right now since I&#39;m stuck in my parent&#39;s house for the summer).
          </p>

          <p>
            I planned to create this website year ago. The primary purpose of it was to be a repository of
            my own thoughts, achievements, knowledge and creations. A blog. A portfolio. A place where
            I can show the world what I&#39;m capable of. Then feature creep happened, and I started bouncing
            all over the place with new languages and frameworks. I&#39;ve restarted this project several
            times.
          </p>

          <p>
            This time, I&#39;m going to force myself to keep things simple. I&#39;m going to make myself
            develop iteratively, rather than trying to do everything at once. Which is why this site looks
            like a static web page. Because it is.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, this blog post is sitting in a file called <code>hello-world.html</code>, in a folder
            named <code>posts</code>, in an Express application (written in pure JavaScript rather than
            CoffeeScript, a change from my previous intention) on a Digital Ocean droplet running Dokku.
            There is no database. There is no template engine being used (I wrote this in Markdown and
            compiled it on the command line).
          </p>

          <p>
            I can almost hear people asking why I&#39;m not using WordPress or something similar. It&#39;s
            because the content isn&#39;t actually the point of this site. I&#39;m building this site to
            practice my skills, to learn new things. I want to learn how system administration works. I
            want to learn HTTP itself. I want to learn about web technologies. I want to learn about databases
            and security. I find those topics, plus several others, interesting. Using something pre made
            will not only make me take things for granted, but will also fail to keep me interested with
            new challenges and problems for me to solve.
          </p>

          <p>
            This site will be a record of what I learn. Over time, it will gain new content, more blog posts,
            maybe links to projects and live demos. But the site itself will also evolve. Its look will
            evolve. It will gain more structure. It will gain new features, such as comments, or highlighting.
            As I keep creating, keep evolving, I intend to document every single thing I do, right here
            on this site.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, hello world. My name is Melvin Sowah.
            <br/>This is the story of my journey.
            <br/>Let me share it with you.
          </p>

          <p>
