          <h1>The First Step</h1>

          <p>
            For the first eighteen years of my life, I thought that I just had to make one great thing, and I&#39;d
            become an instant hit.
          </p>

          <p>
            I remember thinking that when I was a teenager, when I bought RelamCrafter thinking that I could make
            an MMO and make money off it... no, even before that, when I used Eclipse. No, not the IDE,
            the 2D game engine. It was a weird and wonderful piece of kit.
          </p>

          <p>
            I loved making games. I loved building systems, clubs adventures for others to be a part of. Back in
            primary school, I made a club based on Tamagotchis where members would trade items for real
            life Gotchi Points. In hindsight, I&#39;m surprised it worked.</p>

          <p>
            I&#39;ve never been successful in any of my ventures. I started to lose hope, and never really
            realised that my method of doing things wasn&#39;t actually getting me anywhere. It was madness
            to think that I could become an overnight hit with one idea. It can happen, but it wasn&#39;t
            likely. I know that now.
          </p>

          <p>
            I grew up over the last couple of years. I started letting go of perfection. I started realising
            that I don&#39;t actually <em>know</em> anything. I&#39;m creative, but I&#39;m not realistic.
            I have a load of facts in my head, but not enough practice to execute them. I have a wealth
            of abilities, tools at are all rusty from disuse because I keep looking for the next shiny
            trendy skill that every entrepreneur must have.</p>

          <p>
            Throughout secondary school, at least from year 8, I was never really me. Not like I was back
            in primary school, where I was just messing with ideas and having fun with them (sneaking
            around my mother who didn&#39;t want me to go into computer science, the same field she&#39;s
            in herself). It became worse after GCSE&#39;s when I realised I need to make a living at
            some point. I started trying to push myself to be successful in all the wrong ways. I became
            overwhelmed, disinterested, frustrated, burned out. It took messing up my A-Levels and going
            through two years of change to realise how I&#39;ve damaged myself.
          </p>

          <p>My name is Melvin Sowah.
            <br/>I&#39;m 20 years and eleven days old, and I&#39;ll be starting my first year at the University
            of Manchester this September. I call myself a &quot;discreet mathematician&quot; essentially
            meaning that I couldn&#39;t choose between maths and theoretical computer science, so I&#39;m
            doing a joint degree.</p>

          <p>
            I used to be Melvin Sowah, an idiot who <em>thought</em> he knew everything, thought everything
            would just work out, and thought he didn&#39;t really need to put in much effort... well,
            I was never really that person. I myself always tried to work hard, but there was always
            a little part of me that had more influence over me than my actual self. So much so, that
            was the persona I showed to others. That was the mindset that influenced my actions, and
            ultimately resulted in me falling hard on my A-Levels, giving up on project after project
            after it got too difficult, and not really growing anything other than a sense of failure
            and depression.</p>

          <p>
            I took the first step. A two-year long step to what I want to be in the future. I gave up the
            idea that I could coast through life. I gave up the idea that I knew all there was to know
            about programming. I was humbled by those at my first university. I looked myself in the
            mirror and understood why I&#39;ve never been in a relationship.
          </p>

          <p>
            I connected with my younger, child-like self again. The self that loves to learn and play.
            The self that always tried to be happy. The me that always tried to be grateful for what
            he had. The person that wanted everyone else to be happy as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            I kept telling myself that my first job as a barback broke me. I kept telling myself that the
            guy I&#39;m living with next year broke me. They did quite the opposite. If it wasn&#39;t
            for my dad forcing me into a job that had me working until I could see daylight again, if
            it wasn&#39;t for making friends at the uni I first went to, if it wasn&#39;t for meeting
            my new friend on Manchester&#39;s Foundation Year, I&#39;d still be trying to perfect my
            website. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of showing my flaws, what I can&#39;t do, what I don&#39;t know, I&#39;d be trying
            to pretend that I know what I&#39;m talking about (like when I mentioned the &quot;dereferencing
            selection operator&quot; in the first lecture with aforementioned foundation year friend).
          </p>

          <p>
            My wish for this site is to be a record of how I grow from here on out. It is bare bones and
            simple for a reason. I&#39;ll be adding more content in the form of blog posts and projects,
            even YouTube videos. I&#39;ll also be adding more features to practice my skills. Over time,
            I hope that this website will evolve to show what I&#39;ve learned through both itself and
            what it contains.
          </p>

          <p>
            I won&#39;t be posting about just programming on here. I&#39;ll be posting about anything that
            comes to mind really. Anything that interests me and provokes thought. Anything I want to
            discuss with anyone else. Anything I want another perspective on.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&#39;m hoping that by doing so, I&#39;ll never stop growing. I&#39;m hoping that I will never
            do what I did back then, and think that I can take on the world without much thought. I know
            better than that now.
          </p>
