  # Plans

  The last few months have been a bit hectic for me. Launching this blog, acting on a whim and having it pay off, a christening, travelling, working.

  If GCSE English taught me anything, it's that life doesn't go the way you want it to most of the time (GCSE English also taught me how to spin this lesson out of Forrest Gump).

  I'll be at my parents house for ten weeks. This is week five. I planned to be halfway through a Maths book by now. I forgot to leave room for the unexpected. I also forgot to account for having to babysit my little brother. Yeah, my plan has derailed a little.

  The thing about me and planning is that we have a bit of a love-hate relationship: I love making plans, but the plan never seems to want to materialise. I've learned why, and I'll expand on that in another blog post, but the simple version is that I was trying to do too much with too little.

  What I wanted to talk about in this post is my plan for this website.

  If you were to look at the source code for this site, you would see a very basic setup. I'm just parsing Markdown on a command line, then sticking it in a folder. This is a static site at the moment. The only fancy code I've written allows the user to omit the `.html` extension in the URL.

  What I plan to do is let the website evolve over time. It'll be a source of programming challenges for me. Can I implement a login system? How would editing posts work? What about letting people leave comments on the site? (If you have any ideas for programming tasks I could do, [I'd love to hear them!][twitter])

  Over time, this site will evolve. It'll have more features, a better design, cleaner code. The site is supposed to be a living record of my growth and learning, and I thought slowly building the site would be a good way to show that.

  The first challenge I'll set myself is adding a couple of dynamic elements. A sidebar to lists the posts I've made, and a template that will be reused for every blog post. A pretty easy one, but the point of this isn't to immediately push myself. The goal of this for me is to start building a habit and simplify the way I think.

  I'm hoping that by doing a little at a time, every day, I can learn to keep things simple and work on things consistently. If I jumped into something big, I'd get distracted by other ideas I could implement, and eventually get overwhelmed by the ballooning scope of the project.

  A little at a time. That's my plan. Hopefully, it won't go awry this time.
